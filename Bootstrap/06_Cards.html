                    <p class="card-text">Subhash Chandra Bose was one of the most celebrated freedom fighters of India.
                        He was a charismatic influencer of the youth and earned the epithet ‘Netaji’ by establishing and
                        leading the Indian National Army (INA) during India’s struggle for independence. Although
                        initially aligned with the Indian National Congress, he was ousted from the party due to his
                        difference in ideology. He sought assistance from Nazi leadership in Germany and Imperial forces
                        in Japan during the World War II, to overthrow the British from India. His sudden disappearance
                        post 1945, led to surfacing of various theories, concerning the possibilities of his survival.

                            of Hinduism outlined in the Upanishads, was led by his father, Debendranath Tagore.</p>
